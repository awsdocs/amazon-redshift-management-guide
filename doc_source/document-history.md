| Change | Description | Release Date | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|   New JDBC and ODBC drivers   |   Amazon Redshift JDBC drivers have been updated to version 1\.2\.12\.1017\. For more information, see [Configure a JDBC Connection](configure-jdbc-connection.md)\. Amazon Redshift ODBC drivers have been updated to version 1\.4\.1\.1001\. For more information, see [Configure an ODBC Connection](configure-odbc-connection.md)\.   |   March 7, 2018   |

| IAM Role Chaining | If an IAM role attached to your cluster doesn't have access to the necessary resources, you can chain another role, possibly belonging to another account\. Your cluster then temporarily assumes the chained role to access the data\. You can also grant cross\-account access by chaining roles\. Each role in the chain assumes the next role in the chain, until the cluster assumes the role at the end of chain\. You can chain a maximum of 10 roles\. For more information, see [Chaining IAM Roles in Amazon Redshift](authorizing-redshift-service.md#authorizing-redshift-service-chaining-roles)\. | February 23, 2018 |

You might need to update your current trust root CA certificates to continue to connect to your clusters using SSL\. For more information, see [Transitioning to ACM Certificates for SSL Connections](connecting-transitioning-to-acm-certs.md)\. | September 18, 2017 | 
| Service\-linked roles | A service\-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is linked directly to Amazon Redshift\.
