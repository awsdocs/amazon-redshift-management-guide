Your cluster then temporarily assumes the chained role to access the data\. You can also grant cross\-account access by chaining roles\. Each role in the chain assumes the next role in the chain, until the cluster assumes the role at the end of chain\. You can chain a maximum of 10 roles\. For more information, see [Chaining IAM roles in Amazon Redshift](authorizing-redshift-service.md#authorizing-redshift-service-chaining-roles)\. | February 23, 2018 |

| Query monitoring rules | Using WLM query monitoring rules, you can define metrics\-based performance boundaries for WLM queues and specify what action to take when a query goes beyond those boundaries—log, hop, or abort\. You define query monitoring rules as part of your workload management \(WLM\) configuration\. For more information, see [Configuring workload management](workload-mgmt-config.md)\. | April 21, 2017 | 
|  Enhanced VPC routing  |  When you use Amazon Redshift enhanced VPC routing, Amazon Redshift forces all [COPY](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_COPY.html) and [UNLOAD](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_UNLOAD.html) traffic between your cluster and your data repositories through your Amazon VPC\. For more information, see [Enhanced VPC routing in Amazon Redshift](enhanced-vpc-routing.md)\.  |  September 15, 2016  | 
| New connection log fields | The [Connection log](db-auditing.md#db-auditing-connection-log) audit log has two new fields to track SSL connections\. If you routinely load audit logs to an Amazon Redshift table, you will need to add the following new columns to the target table: sslcompression and sslexpansion\. | May 5, 2016 | 
|  New ODBC drivers  |  Amazon Redshift ODBC drivers have been updated to version 1\.2\.7\.1007\. For more information, see [Configuring an ODBC connection](configure-odbc-connection.md)\.  |  March 30, 2016  |
