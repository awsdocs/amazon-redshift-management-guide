# Configuring an ODBC connection<a name="configure-odbc-connection"></a>

You can use an ODBC connection to connect to your Amazon Redshift cluster from many third\-party SQL client tools and applications\. To do this, set up the connection on your client computer or Amazon EC2 instance\. If your client tool supports JDBC, you might choose to use that type of connection rather than ODBC due to the ease of configuration that JDBC provides\. However, if your client tool doesn't support JDBC, follow the steps in this section to configure an ODBC connection\. 

Amazon Redshift provides 64\-bit ODBC drivers for Linux, Windows, and macOS X operating systems\. The 32\-bit ODBC drivers are discontinued\. Further updates will not be released, except for urgent security patches\. 

For the latest information about ODBC driver functionality and prerequisites, see [Amazon Redshift ODBC driver release notes](https://s3.amazonaws.com/redshift-downloads/drivers/odbc/1.4.65.1000/Amazon+Redshift+ODBC+Connector+Release+Notes.pdf)\. 

For installation and configuration information for Amazon Redshift ODBC drivers, see the [Amazon Redshift ODBC connector installation and configuration guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/redshift-downloads/drivers/odbc/1.4.65.1000/Amazon+Redshift+ODBC+Connector+Install+Guide.pdf)\. 

If you want to use an ODBC connection, take the following steps\.

**Topics**
+ [Obtain the ODBC URL for your cluster](#obtain-odbc-url)
+ [Install and configure the Amazon Redshift ODBC driver on Microsoft Windows](#install-odbc-driver-windows)
+ [Install the Amazon Redshift ODBC driver on Linux](#install-odbc-driver-linux)
+ [Install the Amazon Redshift ODBC driver on macOS X](#install-odbc-driver-mac)

+ [Previous ODBC driver versions](#odbc-previous-versions)

## Obtain the ODBC URL for your cluster<a name="obtain-odbc-url"></a>

Amazon Redshift displays the ODBC URL for your cluster in the Amazon Redshift console\. This URL contains the information to set up the connection between your client computer and the database\.

 An ODBC URL has the following format: `Driver={driver};Server=endpoint;Database=database_name;UID=user_name;PWD=password;Port=port_number` 

The fields of the format shown preceding have the following values\.

[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/configure-odbc-connection.html)

 The fields in the preceding tables can contain the following special characters:

```
[]{}(),;?*=!@ 
```

 If you use these special characters you must enclose the value in curly braces\. For example, the password value `Your;password123` in a connection string is represented as `PWD={Your;password123};`\. 

 Since `Field=value` pairs are separated by semicolon, the combination of `}` and `;` with any number of spaces in between is considered the end of a `Field={value};` pair\. We recommend you avoid the sequence `};` in your field values\. For example, if you set your password value as `PWD={This is a passwor} ;d};`, your password would be `This is a passwor} ;` and the URL would error out\. 

The following is an example ODBC URL\.

```
Driver={Amazon Redshift (x64)};
                    Server=examplecluster.abc123xyz789.us-west-2.redshift.amazonaws.com;
                    Database=dev; 
                    UID=adminuser;
                    PWD=insert_your_admin_user_password_here;
                    Port=5439
```

### System requirements<a name="odbc-driver-sysreq-windows"></a>

You install the Amazon Redshift ODBC driver on client computers accessing an Amazon Redshift data warehouse\. Each computer where you install the driver must meet a list of minimum system requirements\. For information about minimum system requirements, see the [Amazon Redshift ODBC connector installation and configuration guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/redshift-downloads/drivers/odbc/1.4.65.1000/Amazon+Redshift+ODBC+Connector+Install+Guide.pdf)\. 

### Installing the Amazon Redshift driver on Windows operating systems<a name="odbc-driver-windows-how-to-install"></a>

Use the following procedure to download the Amazon Redshift ODBC drivers for Windows operating systems\. Only use a driver other than these if you're running a third\-party application that is certified for use with Amazon Redshift and that requires a specific driver\. 

**To install the ODBC driver**

1. Download one of the following, depending on the system architecture of your SQL client tool or application: 
   + [64\-bit ODBC driver version 1\.4\.65](https://s3.amazonaws.com/redshift-downloads/drivers/odbc/1.4.65.1000/AmazonRedshiftODBC64-1.4.65.1000.msi) 

     The name for this driver is Amazon Redshift \(x64\)\.
   + [32\-bit ODBC driver version 1\.4\.52](https://s3.amazonaws.com/redshift-downloads/drivers/odbc/1.4.52.1000/AmazonRedshiftODBC32-1.4.52.1000.msi) 

     The name for this driver is Amazon Redshift \(x86\)\. The 32\-bit ODBC drivers are discontinued\. Further updates will not be released, except for urgent security patches\.
**Note**  
Download the MSI package that corresponds to the system architecture of your SQL client tool or application\. For example, if your SQL client tool is 64\-bit, install the 64\-bit driver\.

    Then download and review the [Amazon Redshift ODBC and JDBC driver license agreement](https://s3.amazonaws.com/redshift-downloads/drivers/Amazon+Redshift+ODBC+and+JDBC+Driver+License+Agreement.pdf)\.  

1.  Double\-click the \.msi file, and then follow the steps in the wizard to install the driver\. 

### Creating a system DSN entry for an ODBC connection on Microsoft Windows<a name="create-dsn-odbc-windows"></a>

After you download and install the ODBC driver, add a data source name \(DSN\) entry to the client computer or Amazon EC2 instance\. SQL client tools use this data source to connect to the Amazon Redshift database\. 

We recommend that you create a system DSN instead of a user DSN\. Some applications load the data using a different user account\. These applications might not be able to detect user DSNs that are created under another user account\.

**Note**  
For authentication using AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) credentials or identity provider \(IdP\) credentials, additional steps are required\. For more information, see [Configure a JDBC or ODBC connection to use IAM credentials](generating-iam-credentials-configure-jdbc-odbc.md)\.

For information about how to create a system DSN entry, see the [Amazon Redshift ODBC connector installation and configuration guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/redshift-downloads/drivers/odbc/1.4.65.1000/Amazon+Redshift+ODBC+Connector+Install+Guide.pdf)\. 

**To create a system DSN entry for an ODBC connection on Windows**

1. In the **Start** menu, open **ODBC Data Sources**\.

   Make sure that you choose the ODBC Data Source Administrator that has the same bitness as the client application that you are using to connect to Amazon Redshift\.

1. In the **ODBC Data Source Administrator**, choose the **Driver** tab and locate the driver folder:
   + **Amazon Redshift ODBC Driver \(64\-bit\)**
   + **Amazon Redshift ODBC Driver \(32\-bit\)**

1.  Choose the **System DSN** tab to configure the driver for all users on the computer, or the **User DSN** tab to configure the driver for your user account only\.

1. Double\-click **AmazonRedshiftODBC\.pkg** to run the installer\.

1. Follow the steps in the installer to complete the driver installation process\. To perform the installation, agree to the terms of the license agreement\.

**Important**  
When you have finished installing the driver, configure it for use on your system\. For more information on driver configuration, see [Use an ODBC driver manager to configure the driver on Linux and macOS X operating systems](#odbc-driver-configure-linux-mac)\.

## Use an ODBC driver manager to configure the driver on Linux and macOS X operating systems<a name="odbc-driver-configure-linux-mac"></a>

On Linux and macOS X operating systems, you use an ODBC driver manager to configure the ODBC connection settings\. ODBC driver managers use configuration files to define and configure ODBC data sources and drivers\. The ODBC driver manager that you use depends on the operating system that you use: 
+ unixODBC driver manager \(for Linux operating systems\)
+ iODBC driver manager \(for macOS X operating system\)

For more information about the supported ODBC driver managers to configure the Amazon Redshift ODBC drivers, see [System requirements](#odbc-driver-sysreq-linux) for Linux operating systems and [System requirements](#odbc-driver-sysreq-mac) for macOS X operating systems\. Also, see "Specifying ODBC Driver Managers on Non\- Windows Machines" in the [Amazon Redshift ODBC connector installation and configuration guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/redshift-downloads/drivers/odbc/1.4.65.1000/Amazon+Redshift+ODBC+Connector+Install+Guide.pdf)\. 

Three files are required for configuring the Amazon Redshift ODBC driver: `amazon.redshiftodbc.ini`, `odbc.ini`, and `odbcinst.ini`\.

If you installed to the default location, the `amazon.redshiftodbc.ini` configuration file is located in one of the following directories:
+ `/opt/amazon/redshiftodbc/lib/64` \(for the 64\-bit driver on Linux operating systems\)
+ `/opt/amazon/redshiftodbc/lib/32` \(for the 32\-bit driver on Linux operating systems\)
+ `/opt/amazon/redshift/lib` \(for the driver on macOS X\)

Additionally, under `/opt/amazon/redshiftodbc/Setup` on Linux or /opt/amazon/redshift/Setup on macOS X, there are sample `odbc.ini` and `odbcinst.ini` files\. You can use these files as examples for configuring the Amazon Redshift ODBC driver and the data source name \(DSN\)\.

We don't recommend using the Amazon Redshift ODBC driver installation directory for the configuration files\. The sample files in the `Setup` directory are for example purposes only\. If you reinstall the Amazon Redshift ODBC driver at a later time, or upgrade to a newer version, the installation directory is overwritten\. You then lose any changes that you might have made to those files\.

To avoid this, copy the `amazon.redshiftodbc.ini` file to a directory other than the installation directory\. If you copy this file to the user's home directory, add a period \(\.\) to the beginning of the file name to make it a hidden file\.

For the `odbc.ini` and `odbcinst.ini` files, either use the configuration files in the user's home directory or create new versions in another directory\. By default, your Linux or macOS X operating system should have an `odbc.ini` file and an `odbcinst.ini` file in the user's home directory \(`/home/$USER` or `~/`\.\)\. These default files are hidden files, which is indicated by the dot \(\.\) in front of each file name\. These files display only when you use the `-a` flag to list the directory contents\.

Whichever option you choose for the `odbc.ini` and `odbcinst.ini` files, modify the files to add driver and DSN configuration information\. If you create new files, you also need to set environment variables to specify where these configuration files are located\. 

By default, ODBC driver managers are configured to use hidden versions of the `odbc.ini` and `odbcinst.ini` configuration files \(named \.`odbc.ini` and \.`odbcinst.ini`\) located in the home directory\. They also are configured to use the `amazon.redshiftodbc.ini` file in the `/lib` subfolder of the driver installation directory\. If you store these configuration files elsewhere, set the environment variables described following so that the driver manager can locate the files\. For more information, see "Specifying the Locations of the Driver Configuration Files" in the [Amazon Redshift ODBC connector installation and configuration guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/redshift-downloads/drivers/odbc/1.4.65.1000/Amazon+Redshift+ODBC+Connector+Install+Guide.pdf)\. 

### Creating a data source name on Linux and macOS X operating systems<a name="configure-odbc-ini-file"></a>

 When connecting to your data store using a data source name \(DSN\), configure the `odbc.ini` file to define DSNs\. Set the properties in the `odbc.ini` file to create a DSN that specifies the connection information for your data store\.

For information about how to configure the `odbc.ini` file, see "Creating a Data Source Name on a Non\-Windows Machine" in the [Amazon Redshift ODBC connector installation and configuration guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/redshift-downloads/drivers/odbc/1.4.65.1000/Amazon+Redshift+ODBC+Connector+Install+Guide.pdf) 

 Use the following format on Linux operating systems\.

```
[ODBC Data Sources]
driver_name=dsn_name

[dsn_name]
Driver=path/driver_file

Host=cluster_endpoint
Port=port_number
Database=database_name
locale=locale
```

The following example shows the configuration for odbc\.ini with the 64\-bit ODBC driver on Linux operating systems\.

```
[ODBC Data Sources]
Amazon_Redshift_x64=Amazon Redshift (x64)

[Amazon Redshift (x64)]

```

### Configuring a connection without a DSN on Linux and macOS X operating systems<a name="configure-odbcinst-ini-file"></a>

To connect to your data store through a connection that doesn't have a DSN, define the driver in the `odbcinst.ini` file\. Then provide a DSN\-less connection string in your application\.

For information about how to configure the `odbcinst.ini` file in this case, see "Configuring a DSN\-less Connection on a Non\-Windows Machine" in the [Amazon Redshift ODBC connector installation and configuration guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/redshift-downloads/drivers/odbc/1.4.65.1000/Amazon+Redshift+ODBC+Connector+Install+Guide.pdf)\. 

Use the following format on Linux operating systems\.

```
[ODBC Drivers]
driver_name=Installed
...
                            
[driver_name]

```

### Configuring environment variables<a name="rs-mgmt-config-global-env-variables"></a>

Use the correct ODBC driver manager to load the correct driver\. To do this, set the library path environment variable\. For more information, see "Specifying ODBC Driver Managers on Non\-Windows Machines" in the [Amazon Redshift ODBC connector installation and configuration guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/redshift-downloads/drivers/odbc/1.4.65.1000/Amazon+Redshift+ODBC+Connector+Install+Guide.pdf)\. 

By default, ODBC driver managers are configured to use hidden versions of the `odbc.ini` and `odbcinst.ini` configuration files \(named \.`odbc.ini` and \.`odbcinst.ini`\) located in the home directory\. They also are configured to use the `amazon.redshiftodbc.ini` file in the `/lib` subfolder of the driver installation directory\. If you store these configuration files elsewhere, the environment variables so that the driver manager can locate the files\. For more information, see "Specifying the Locations of the Driver Configuration Files" in *Amazon Redshift ODBC Connector Installation and Configuration Guide*\. 

### Configuring connection features<a name="connection-config-features"></a>

You can configure the following connection features for your ODBC setting:
+ Configure the ODBC driver to provide credentials and authenticate the connection to the Amazon Redshift database\.
+ Configure the ODBC driver to connect to a socket enabled with Secure Sockets Layer \(SSL\), if you are connecting to an Amazon Redshift server that has SSL enabled\.
+ Configure the ODBC driver to connect to Amazon Redshift through a proxy server\.
+ Configure the ODBC driver to use a query processing mode to prevent queries from consuming too much memory\.
+ Configure the ODBC driver to pass IAM authentication processes through a proxy server\.
+ Configure the ODBC driver to use TCP keepalives to prevent connections from timing out\.

For information about these connection features, see the [Amazon Redshift ODBC connector installation and configuration guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/redshift-downloads/drivers/odbc/1.4.65.1000/Amazon+Redshift+ODBC+Connector+Install+Guide.pdf)\. 

## Configure ODBC driver options<a name="configure-odbc-options"></a>

You can use configuration options to control the behavior of the Amazon Redshift ODBC driver\.

In Microsoft Windows, you typically set driver options when you configure a data source name \(DSN\)\. You can also set driver options in the connection string when you connect programmatically, or by adding or changing registry keys in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ODBC\ODBC.INI\your_DSN`\. For more information about configuring a DSN, see [Install and configure the Amazon Redshift ODBC driver on Microsoft Windows](#install-odbc-driver-windows)\. For an example of setting driver options in a connection string, see [Connect to your cluster programmatically](connecting-in-code.md)\.

In Linux and macOS X, you set driver configuration options in your `odbc.ini` and `amazon.redshiftodbc.ini` files, as described in [Use an ODBC driver manager to configure the driver on Linux and macOS X operating systems](#odbc-driver-configure-linux-mac)\. Configuration options set in an `amazon.redshiftodbc.ini` file apply to all connections\. In contrast, configuration options set in an `odbc.ini` file are specific to a connection\. Configuration options set in `odbc.ini` take precedence over configuration options set in `amazon.redshiftodbc.ini`\.

For information about how to set up ODBC driver configuration options, see the [Amazon Redshift ODBC connector installation and configuration guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/redshift-downloads/drivers/odbc/1.4.65.1000/Amazon+Redshift+ODBC+Connector+Install+Guide.pdf)\.
