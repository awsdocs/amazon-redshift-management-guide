# Amazon Redshift Serverless feature overview<a name="serverless-considerations"></a>

Most of the features supported by an Amazon Redshift provisioned data warehouse are also supported by Amazon Redshift Serverless\. The following are some of its key capabilities\. 


| Feature | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| **Snapshots** | You can restore a snapshot of Amazon Redshift Serverless or a provisioned data warehouse to Amazon Redshift Serverless\. For more information, see [Working with snapshots and recovery points](serverless-snapshots-recovery.md#serverless-snapshots-recovery-points)\. | 
| **Recovery points ** | Amazon Redshift Serverless automatically creates a point of recovery every 30 minutes\. These recovery points are kept for 24 hours\. You can use them to restore after accidental writes or deletes\. When you restore from a recovery point, all the data in your Amazon Redshift Serverless database is restored to an earlier point in time\. You can also create a snapshot from a recovery point if you need to keep a point of recovery for a longer period\. For more information, see [Working with snapshots and recovery points](serverless-snapshots-recovery.md#serverless-snapshots-recovery-points)\.  | 
| **Base RPU capacity** | You can set a base capacity in Redshift Processing Units \(RPUs\)\. One RPU provides 16 GB of memory\. This setting gives you the ability to control the balance between resources in use and cost for your workload\. You can increase this value to grow resources available and improve query performance, or lower the value to limit your spending\. The default is 128 RPUs\. You can also set usage limits, such as RPUs used per day, to control costs\. For more information, see [Billing for Amazon Redshift Serverless](serverless-billing.md)\. | 
| **Usage limits of data sharing** | You can limit the amount of data transferred from a producer Region to a consumer Region using the console or the API\. These data transfer costs differ by AWS Region, and are measured in terabytes\. For more information about data sharing, see [Getting started data sharing using the console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/getting-started-datashare-console.html) in the *Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide*\. | 
| **User\-defined functions \(UDFs\)** | You can run user\-defined functions \(UDFs\) in Amazon Redshift Serverless\. For more information, see [Creating user\-defined functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/user-defined-functions.html) in the *Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide*\. | 
| **Stored procedures** | You can run stored procedures in Amazon Redshift Serverless\. For more information, see [Creating stored procedures](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/stored-procedure-overview.html) in the *Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide*\. | 
| **Materialized views** | You can create materialized views in Amazon Redshift Serverless\. For more information, see [Creating materialized views](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/materialized-view-overview.html) in the *Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide*\. | 
| **Spatial functions** | You can run spatial functions in Amazon Redshift Serverless\. For more information, see [Querying spatial data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/geospatial-overview.html) in the *Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide*\. | 
| **Federated queries** | You can run queries to join data with Aurora and Amazon RDS databases from Amazon Redshift Serverless\. For more information, see [Querying data with federated queries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/federated-overview.html) in the *Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide*\. | 
| **Data lake queries** | You can run queries to join data from your Amazon S3 data lake with Amazon Redshift Serverless\. For more information, see [Querying a data lake](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/query-editor-v2-querying-data-lake.html) in the *Amazon Redshift Management Guide*\. | 
| **HyperLogLog** | You can run HyperLogLog functions in Amazon Redshift Serverless\. For more information, see [Using HyperLogLog sketches](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/hyperloglog-overview.html) in the *Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide*\. | 
| **Querying data across databases** | You can query data across databases with Amazon Redshift Serverless\. For more information, see [Querying data across databases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/cross-database-overview.html) in the *Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide*\. | 
| **Data sharing** | You can access datashares on provisioned data warehouses with Amazon Redshift Serverless\. For more information, see [Sharing data across clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/datashare-overview.html) in the *Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide*\. | 
| **Semistructured data querying** | You can ingest and store semistructured data with the `SUPER` data type with Amazon Redshift Serverless\. For more information, see [Ingesting and querying semistructured data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/super-overview.html) in the *Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide*\. | 
| **Tagging resources** | You can use the AWS CLI or the Amazon Redshift Serverless API to tag resources with metadata related to the resource\. For more information, see [Tagging resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/serverless-tagging-resources.html)\. | 
| **Machine learning** | You can use Amazon Redshift machine learning with Amazon Redshift Serverless\. For more information, see [Using machine learning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/machine_learning.html) in the *Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide*\. | 
| **SQL commands and functions** | With a few exceptions \(such as `REBOOT_CLUSTER`\), you can use Amazon Redshift SQL commands and functions with Amazon Redshift Serverless\. For more information, see [SQL reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/cm_chap_SQLCommandRef.html) in the *Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide*\. | 
| **CloudFormation resources** | Using CloudFormation templates, you can deploy and update Amazon Redshift Serverless resources\. This integration means you can spend less time managing resources and focus on your applications\. For more information about CloudFormation resources in Amazon Redshift Serverless, see [Amazon Redshift Serverless resource type reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/AWS_RedshiftServerless.html)\. | 
| **CloudTrail resources** | Amazon Redshift Serverless is integrated with AWS CloudTrail in order to provide a record of actions taken in Amazon Redshift Serverless\. CloudTrail captures all API calls for Amazon Redshift Serverless as events\. For more information, see [CloudTrail for Amazon Redshift Serverless](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/logging-with-cloudtrail.html)\. |
