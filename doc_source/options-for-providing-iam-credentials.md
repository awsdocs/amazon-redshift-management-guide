# Options for providing IAM credentials<a name="options-for-providing-iam-credentials"></a>

To provide IAM credentials for a JDBC or ODBC connection, choose one of the following options\.
+ **AWS profile** 

  As an alternative to providing credentials values in the form of JDBC or ODBC settings, you can put the values in a named profile\. For more information, see [Using a Configuration Profile](#using-configuration-profile)\.
+ **IAM credentials**

  Provide values for AccessKeyID, SecretAccessKey, and, optionally, SessionToken in the form of JDBC or ODBC settings\. SessionToken is required only for an IAM role with temporary credentials\. For more information, see [JDBC and ODBC options for providing IAM credentials](#jdbc-options-for-providing-iam-credentials)\.
+ **Identity provider federation** 

  When you use identity provider federation to enable users from an identity provider to authenticate to Amazon Redshift, specify the name of a credential provider plugin\. For more information, see [Using a credentials provider plugin](#using-credentials-provider-plugin)\.

  The Amazon Redshift JDBC and ODBC drivers include plugins for the following SAML\-based identity federation credential providers: 
  + Microsoft Active Identity Federation Services \(AD FS\)
  + PingOne
  + Okta
  + Microsoft Azure Active Directory \(Azure AD\)

  You can provide the plugin name and related values in the form of JDBC or ODBC settings or by using a profile\. For more information, see [Configure JDBC driver options](configure-jdbc-connection.md#configure-jdbc-options) and [Configure ODBC driver options](configure-odbc-connection.md#configure-odbc-options)\. 

For more information, see [Configure a JDBC or ODBC connection to use IAM credentials](generating-iam-credentials-configure-jdbc-odbc.md)\.

## Using a Configuration Profile<a name="using-configuration-profile"></a>

You can supply the IAM credentials options and `GetClusterCredentials` options as settings in named profiles in your AWS configuration file\. To provide the profile name, use the Profile JDBC option\. The configuration is stored in a file named `config` in a folder named `.aws` in your home directory\. 

For a SAML\-based credential provider plugin included with an Amazon Redshift JDBC or ODBC driver, you can use the settings described just preceding in [Using a credentials provider plugin](#using-credentials-provider-plugin)\. If `plugin_name` isn't used, the other options are ignored\.

The following example shows a configuration file with two profiles\. 

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
aws_secret_access_key=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY

[user2]
aws_access_key_id=AKIAI44QH8DHBEXAMPLE
aws_secret_access_key=je7MtGbClwBF/2Zp9Utk/h3yCo8nvbEXAMPLEKEY
session_token=AQoDYXdzEPT//////////wEXAMPLEtc764bNrC9SAPBSM22wDOk4x4HIZ8j4FZTwdQWLWsKWHGBuFqwAeMicRXmxfpSPfIeoIYRqTflfKD8YUuwthAx7mSEI/qkPpKPi/kMcGd

+scqKmlzm8FDrypNC9Yjc8fPOLn9FX9KSYvKTr4rvx3iSIlTJabIQwj2ICCR/oLxBA==
```

To use the credentials for the `user2` example, specify `Profile=user2` in the JDBC URL\.

## JDBC and ODBC options for providing IAM credentials<a name="jdbc-options-for-providing-iam-credentials"></a>

The following table lists the JDBC and ODBC options for providing IAM credentials\.

[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/options-for-providing-iam-credentials.html)

## Using a credentials provider plugin<a name="using-credentials-provider-plugin"></a>

Amazon Redshift uses credentials provider plugins for SSO authentication\.

To support SSO authentication, Amazon Redshift provides the Azure AD plugin for Microsoft Azure Active Directory\. For information on how to configure this plugin, see [Setting up JDBC or ODBC single sign\-on authentication with Microsoft Azure AD](#setup-azure-ad-identity-provider)\.

### Setting up multi\-factor authentication<a name="setting_mfa"></a>

To support multi\-factor authentication \(MFA\), Amazon Redshift provides browser\-based plugins\. Use the browser SAML plugin for Okta, PingOne, and Active Directory Federation Services, and the browser Azure AD plugin for Microsoft Azure Active Directory\.

With the browser SAML plugin, SAML authentication flows like this:

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/images/BrowserSAML_plugin.png)

1. A user tries to log in\.

1. The plugin launches a local server to listen to incoming connections on the localhost\.

1. The plugin launches a web browser to request a SAML response over HTTPS from the specified SSO login URL federated identity provider endpoint\.

1. The web browser follows the link and prompts the user to enter credentials\.

1. After the user authenticates and grants consent, the federated identity provider endpoint returns a SAML response over HTTPS to the URI indicated by `redirect_uri`\.

1. The web browser moves the response message with the SAML response to the indicated `redirect_uri`\.

1. The local server accepts the incoming connection and the plugin retrieves the SAML response and passes it to Amazon Redshift\.

With the browser Azure AD plugin, SAML authentication flows like this:

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/images/BrowserAzure_plugin.png)

1. A user tries to log in\.

1. The plugin launches a local server to listen to incoming connections on the localhost\.

1. The plugin launches a web browser to request an authorization code from the Azure AD `oauth2/authorize` endpoint\.

1. The web browser follows the generated link over HTTPS and prompts the user to enter credentials\. The link is generated using configuration properties, such as tenant and client\_id\.

1. After the user authenticates and grants consent, the Azure AD `oauth2/authorize` endpoint returns and sends a response over HTTPS with the authorization code to the indicated `redirect_uri`\.

1. The web browser moves the response message with the SAML response to the indicated `redirect_uri`\.

1. The local server accepts the incoming connection and the plugin requests and retrieves the authorization code and sends a POST request to the Azure AD `oauth2/token` endpoint\.

1. The Azure AD `oauth2/token` endpoint returns a response with an access token to the indicated `redirect_uri`\.

1. The plugin retrieves the SAML response and passes it to Amazon Redshift\.

Amazon Redshift provides the following credentials provider plugins:
+ Active Directory Federation Services \(AD FS\)

  For more information, see [Setting up JDBC or ODBC Single Sign\-on authentication with AD FS](#setup-adfs-identity-provider)\.
+ PingOne \(Ping\) 

  Ping is supported only with the predetermined PingOne IdP Adapter using Forms authentication\. 

  For more information, see [Setting up JDBC or ODBC Single Sign\-on authentication with Ping Identity](#setup-pingfederate-identity-provider)\.
+ Okta 

  Okta is supported only for the Okta\-supplied application used with the AWS Management Console\. 

  For more information, see [Setting up JDBC or ODBC Single Sign\-on authentication with Okta](#setup-okta-identity-provider)\.
+ Microsoft Azure Active Directory

  For more information, see [Setting up JDBC or ODBC single sign\-on authentication with Microsoft Azure AD](#setup-azure-ad-identity-provider)\.

### Configuring plugin options<a name="configuring_plugin_options"></a>

To use a SAML\-based credentials provider plugin, specify the following options using JBDC or ODBC options or in a named profile\. If `plugin_name` isn't specified, the other options are ignored\. 

[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/options-for-providing-iam-credentials.html)

## Setting up JDBC or ODBC single sign\-on authentication with Microsoft Azure AD<a name="setup-azure-ad-identity-provider"></a>

You can use Microsoft Azure AD as an identity provider \(IdP\) to access your Amazon Redshift cluster\. Following, you can find a procedure that describes how to set up a trust relationship for this purpose\. For more information about configuring AWS as a service provider for the IdP, see [Configuring Your SAML 2\.0 IdP with Relying Party Trust and Adding Claims](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_saml_relying-party.html#saml_relying-party) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

**Note**  
To use Azure AD with JDBC, the Amazon Redshift JDBC driver must be version 1\.2\.37\.1061 or later\. To use Azure AD with ODBC, the Amazon Redshift ODBC driver must be version 1\.4\.10\.1000 or later\. 

To learn how to federate Amazon Redshift access with Microsoft Azure AD single sign\-on, watch the following video\.

       ]
   }
   ```

   This policy grants permissions as follows:
   + The first section grants permission to the `GetClusterCredentials` API operation to get temporary credentials for the specified cluster\. In this example, the resource is `cluster-identifier` with database *`dev`*, in account *`123456789012`*, and in AWS Region *`us-west-1`*\. The `${redshift:DbUser}` clause allows only users that match the `DbUser` value specified in Azure AD to connect\.
   + The condition clause enforces that only certain users get temporary credentials\. These are users under the role specified by the role unique ID *`AROAJ2UCCR6DPCEXAMPLE`* in the IAM account identified by an email address in your company's email domain\. For more information about unique IDs, see [Unique IDs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-unique-ids) in the *IAM User Guide*\. 

     Your setup with your IdP \(in this case, Azure AD\) determines how the condition clause is written\. If your employee's email is `johndoe@example.com`, first set `${redshift:DbUser}` to the super field that matches the employee's user name `johndoe`\. Then, to make this condition work, set the AWS SAML `RoleSessionName` field to the super field that matches the employee’s email `johndoe@example.com`\. When you take this approach, consider the following:
     + If you set `${redshift:DbUser}` to be the employee's email, then remove the `@example.com` in the example JSON to match the `RoleSessionName`\. 
     + If you set the `RoleSessionId` to be just the employee's user name, then remove the `@example.com` in the example to match the `RoleSessionName`\. 
     + In the example JSON, the `${redshift:DbUser}` and `RoleSessionName` are both set to the employee's email\. This example JSON uses the Amazon Redshift database user name with `@example.com` to sign the user in to access the cluster\.
   + The second section grants permission to create a `dbuser` name in the specified cluster\. In this example JSON, it restricts creation to `${redshift:DbUser}`\. 
   + The third section grants permission to specify which `dbgroup` a user can join\. In this example JSON, a user can join the `my_dbgroup` group in the specified cluster\. 
   + The fourth section grants permission to actions the user can do on all resources\. In this example JSON, it allows users to call `redshift:DescribeClusters` to get cluster information such as the cluster endpoint, AWS Region, and port\. It also allows users to call `iam:ListRoles` to check which roles a user can assume\. 

**To set up JDBC for authentication to Microsoft Azure AD**
+ Configure your database client to connect to your cluster through JDBC using your Azure AD single sign\-on\. 

  You can use any client that uses a JDBC driver to connect using Azure AD single sign\-on or use a language like Java to connect using a script\. For installation and configuration information, see [Configuring a JDBC connection](configure-jdbc-connection.md)\.

  For example, you can use SQLWorkbench/J as the client\. When you configure SQLWorkbench/J, the URL of your database uses the following format\.

  ```
  jdbc:redshift:iam://cluster-identifier:us-west-1/dev
  ```

  If you use SQLWorkbench/J as the client, take the following steps:

  1. Start SQL Workbench/J\. On the **Select Connection Profile** page, add a **Profile Group** called **AzureAuth**\.

  1. For **Connection Profile**, enter **Azure**\.

  1. Choose **Manage Drivers**, and choose **Amazon Redshift**\. Choose the **Open Folder** icon next to **Library**, then choose the appropriate JDBC \.jar file\. 

  1. On the **Select Connection Profile** page, add information to the connection profile as follows:
     + For **User**, enter your Microsoft Azure user name\. This is the user name of the Microsoft Azure account that you are using for single sign\-on that has permission to the cluster that you are trying to authenticate using\.
     + For **Password**, enter your Microsoft Azure password\.
     + For **Drivers**, choose **Amazon Redshift \(com\.amazon\.redshift\.jdbc\.Driver\)**\.
     + For **URL**, enter **jdbc:redshift:iam//*your\-cluster\-identifier*:*your\-cluster\-region*/*your\-database\-name***\.

  1. Choose **Extended Properties** to add additional information to the connection properties, as described following\.

     For Azure AD SSO configuration, add additional information as follows:

     + For **User**, enter your Okta user name\. This is the user name of the Okta account that you are using for single sign\-on that has permission to the cluster that you are trying to authenticate using\.
     + For **Password**, enter your Okta password\.
     + For **Drivers**, choose **Amazon Redshift \(com\.amazon\.redshift\.jdbc\.Driver\)**\.
     + For **URL**, enter **jdbc:redshift:iam//*your\-cluster\-identifier*:*your\-cluster\-region*/*your\-database\-name***\.

  1. Choose **Extended Properties** and do one of the following:
     + For **login\_url**, enter ***your\-okta\-sso\-login\-url***\. This value specifies to the URL to use SSO as the authentication to log in to Okta\. 
     + For Okta SSO, for **plugin\_name**, enter **com\.amazon\.redshift\.plugin\.OktaCredentialsProvider**\. This value specifies to the driver to use Okta SSO as the authentication method\. 
     + For Okta SSO with MFA, for **plugin\_name**, enter **com\.amazon\.redshift\.plugin\.SamlCredentialsProvider**\. This value specifies to the driver to use Okta SSO with MFA as the authentication method\. 

**To set up ODBC for authentication to Okta**
+ Configure your database client to connect to your cluster through ODBC using Okta SSO\. 

  Amazon Redshift provides ODBC drivers for Linux, Windows, and macOS operating systems\. Before you install an ODBC driver, determine whether your SQL client tool is 32\-bit or 64\-bit\. Install the ODBC driver that matches the requirements of your SQL client tool\. 

  Also install and configure the latest Amazon Redshift OBDC driver for your operating system as follows:
  + For Windows, see [Install and configure the Amazon Redshift ODBC driver on Microsoft Windows](configure-odbc-connection.md#install-odbc-driver-windows)\.
  + For macOS, see [Install the Amazon Redshift ODBC driver on macOS X](configure-odbc-connection.md#install-odbc-driver-mac)\.
  + For Linux, see [Install the Amazon Redshift ODBC driver on Linux](configure-odbc-connection.md#install-odbc-driver-linux)\.

  On Windows, in the **Amazon Redshift ODBC Driver DSN Setup** page, under **Connection Settings**, enter the following information: 
  + For **Data Source Name**, enter ***your\-DSN***\. This specifies the data source name used as the ODBC profile name\. 
  + For **Auth type**, do one of the following:
    + For Okta SSO configuration, choose **Identity Provider: Okta**\. This is the authentication method that the ODBC driver uses to authenticate using Okta SSO\.
    + For Okta SSO with MFA configuration, choose **Identity Provider: Browser SAML**\. This is the authentication method that the ODBC driver uses to authenticate using Okta SSO with MFA\.
  + For **Cluster ID**, enter ***your\-cluster\-identifier***\. 
  + For **Region**, enter ***your\-cluster\-region***\.
  + For **Database**, enter ***your\-database\-name***\.
  + For **User**, enter ***your\-okta\-username***\. This is the user name for the Okta account that you are using for SSO that has permission to the cluster that you're trying to authenticate using\. Use this only for **Auth type** is **Identity Provider: Okta**\.
  + For **Password**, enter ***your\-okta\-password***\. Use this only for **Auth type** is **Identity Provider: Okta**\. 

  On macOS and Linux, edit the `odbc.ini` file as follows: 
**Note**  
All entries are case\-insensitive\.
  + For **clusterid**, enter ***your\-cluster\-identifier***\. This is the name of the created Amazon Redshift cluster\.
  + For **region**, enter ***your\-cluster\-region***\. This is the AWS Region of the created Amazon Redshift cluster\.
  + For **database**, enter ***your\-database\-name***\. This is the name of the database that you're trying to access on the Amazon Redshift cluster\.
  + For **locale**, enter **en\-us**\. This is the language that error messages display in\.
  + For **iam**, enter **1**\. This value specifies to the driver to authenticate using IAM credentials\.
  + For **plugin\_name**, do one of the following:
    + For Okta SSO with MFA configuration, enter **BrowserSAML**\. This is the authentication method that the ODBC driver uses to authenticate to Okta SSO with MFA\. 
    + For Okta SSO configuration, enter **Okta**\. This is the authentication method that the ODBC driver uses to authenticate using Okta SSO\. 
  + For **uid**, enter ***your\-okta\-username***\. This is the user name of the Okta account you are using for SSO that has permission to the cluster you are trying to authenticate against\. Use this only for **plugin\_name** is **Okta**\.
  + For **pwd**, enter ***your\-okta\-password***\. Use this only for **plugin\_name** is **Okta**\. 
  + For **login\_url**, enter ***your\-login\-url***\. This is the Initiate SSO URL that returns the SAML Response\. This applies only to the Browser SAML plugin\.
  + For **idp\_response\_timeout**, enter ***the\-number\-of\-seconds***\. This is the specified period of time in seconds to wait for response from PingOne\. This applies only to the Browser SAML plugin\.
  + For **listen\_port**, enter ***your\-listen\-port***\. This is the port that local server is listening to\. The default is 7890\. This applies only to the Browser SAML plugin\.

  On macOS and Linux, also edit the profile settings to add the following exports\.

  ```
  export ODBCINI=/opt/amazon/redshift/Setup/odbc.ini
  ```

  ```
  export ODBCINSTINI=/opt/amazon/redshift/Setup/odbcinst.ini
  ```
