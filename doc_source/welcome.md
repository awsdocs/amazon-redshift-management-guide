# What is Amazon Redshift?<a name="welcome"></a>

Welcome to the *Amazon Redshift Management Guide*\. Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte\-scale data warehouse service in the cloud\. Amazon Redshift Serverless lets you access and analyze data without all of the configurations of a provisioned data warehouse\. Resources are automatically provisioned and data warehouse capacity is intelligently scaled to deliver fast performance for even the most demanding and unpredictable workloads\. You don't incur charges when the data warehouse is idle, so you only pay for what you use\. You can load data and start querying right away in the Amazon Redshift query editor v2 or in your favorite business intelligence \(BI\) tool\. Enjoy the best price performance and familiar SQL features in an easy\-to\-use, zero administration environment\.

Regardless of the size of the dataset, Amazon Redshift offers fast query performance using the same SQL\-based tools and business intelligence applications that you use today\.

 If you are a first\-time user of Amazon Redshift, we recommend that you begin by reading the following sections: 
+ [Service Highlights and Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/redshift-serverless) – This product detail page provides the Amazon Redshift value proposition, service highlights, and pricing\.
+ [Getting started with Amazon Redshift Serverless](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/serverless-new-user.html) – This topic walks you through the process of setting up a serverless data warehouse, creating resources, and querying sample data\. 
+ [Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/) – If you are a database developer, this guide explains how to design, build, query, and maintain the databases that make up your data warehouse\.

If you prefer to manage your Amazon Redshift resources manually, you can create provisioned clusters for your data querying needs\. For more information, see [Amazon Redshift clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-clusters.html)\.

As an application developer, you can use the Amazon Redshift API or the AWS Software Development Kit \(SDK\) libraries to manage clusters programmatically\. If you use the Amazon Redshift Query API, you must authenticate every HTTP or HTTPS request to the API by signing it\. For more information about signing requests, go to [Signing an HTTP request](amazon-redshift-signing-requests.md)\.
